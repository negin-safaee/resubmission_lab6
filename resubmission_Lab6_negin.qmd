Lab 6 : Quarto Presentation

## Some important literature:

Predicting protein structure from the amino acid sequence has been a challenge with theoretical and practical significance in biophysics. Despite the recent progresses elicited by improved inter-residue contact prediction, contact-based structure prediction has gradually reached the performance ceiling. New methods have been proposed to predict the inter-residue distance, but unanimously by simplifying the real-valued distance prediction into a multiclass classification problem.

## example

$$ vts = tanh(\frac{5*Vrs - 50}{12}) $$
